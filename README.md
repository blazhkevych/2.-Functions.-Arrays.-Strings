## 1. 
Implement the simplest version of the test, issuing in turn
user questions that require one-word answers ("Yes" and "No").
After passing the test, display the result. Questions and marks for
store each question in the script as arrays.

## 2. 
The user is required to enter a full name. It is necessary that the script
checked the user input for invalid characters.
Invalid characters are any characters other than letters,
spaces and dots. These characters can be specified in the script as a string.

## 3. 
Divide the entered http-address into its component parts.
For example, the address “http://www.ufa.com.ua/utilites/hdd/out.php?sort=2”
is divided into the following components:

protocol - http:

host - www.ufa.com.ua

path - /utilities/hdd/

filename - out.php

query string - sort=2

## 4. 
Display a chessboard on the page using the DOM.
